The document you're currently reading is called a **notebook**, a name that comes from Jupyter Notebook, the project on which Google Colaboratory is based. Naturally, Jupyter has been around longer than Colaboratory has and runs a multitude of programming languages, but as of this writing, Colaboratory only runs Python 2 and 3. Luckily for us, this curriculum is based on Python.\n","\n","Given that Colaboratory is a Google product, Colaboratory Notebooks are hosted in Google Drive and can be viewed in the same manner as other files such as Google Docs. Much like Docs, Notebooks have an **outline** viewable on the left side which allow the user to jump between sections.\n","\n","A useful tool when running code in Colaboratory (that is, when you're viewing the demos and working on projects) is the **Runtime tab**. Clicking on this tab will open a menu with various options that will allow you to run multiple code cells simultaneously. For example, \"Run before\" will run all the code cells before the currently selected cell in order starting with the first. This is particularly helpful if you run into an error while editing your code and you want to ensure all the variables and data have been initialized properly prior to the cell you're working on."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PG0i6_ixY_kp","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Intro: What is ML?\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_3DhAwDk5C79","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**[Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence: Crash Course CS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-EtmaFJieY&index=35&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo):**  (11:50)\n","\n","To get started, Carrie Anne - an award-winning Computing Teacher, Author & YouTuber will provide a friendly introduction into artificial intelligence and its subfield machine learning.
